## About the Project

Steering input is one of the key fundamental insights into driving behavior, performance and style. However, there is no straightforward public source, tool or API to access steering angle data. The only available source is onboard camera footage, which comes with its own limitations, such as camera position, shadows, weather conditions, and lighting.

- The **F1 Steering Angle Prediction Model** uses a CNN based on EfficientNet-B0 to predict steering angles from a F1 onboard camera footage, trained with over 25,000 images (7000 manual labaled augmented to 25000) and YOLOv8-seg nano for helmets segmentation, allowing the model to be more robust by erasing helmet designs.
        
- Currentlly the model is able to predict steering angles from 180° to -180° with a 3°-5° of error on ideal contitions.

- EfficientNet-B0 and YOLOv8-seg nano are exported to ONNX format, and images are resized to 224x224 allowing it to run on low-end devices.
                    

#####
## How It Works

##### Video Processing: 
- From the onboard camera video, the frames selected are extracted at the FPS rate.
            
##### Image Preprocessing:
- The frames are cropeed based on selected crop type to focus on the steering wheel and driver area.
- YOLOv8-seg nano is applied to the cropped images to segment the helmet, removing designs and logos.
- Convert cropped images to grayscale and apply CLAHE to enhance visibility.
- Apply adaptive Canny edge detection to extract edges, helped with preprocessing techniques like bilateralFilter and morphological transformations.

##### Prediction: 
- The CNN model processes the edge image to predict the steering angle
            
##### Postprocessing
- apply local a trend-based outlier correction algorithm to detect and correct outliers
            
##### Results Visualization
- Angles are displayed as a line chart with statistical analysis also a csv file with the frame number, time and the steering angle.

### Performance Analysis

After extensive development, the model has achieved the following performance metrics:
- From 0 to ±90° = 3° of ground truth
- From ±90° to ±180° = 5° of ground truth

**Limitations**: Performance may decrease in:
- Low visibility conditions (rain, extreme shadows)
- Low quality videos (low resolution, high compression)
- Changed camera positions (different angle, height)
